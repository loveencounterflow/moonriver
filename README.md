# MoonRiver

## Notes

* ðŸš§ Work in progress ðŸš§
* see [here](https://github.com/loveencounterflow/hengist/tree/master/dev/moonriver/src) for examples and
  tests
* in pipelines,
  * <del>a function with zero arguments will be called for its result; the result can take on any role (source,
    transform, or sink)</del> <ins>under review</ins>
  * a function with one argument will be called only with the current data item `d`; its return value will
    be discarded (so-called observers)
  * use `$map f` to turn an ordinary synchronous function into a transform
  * a function with two arguments will be called once for each lap; it must return a value that can be used
    as a transform ( such as a list of values, an iterator, a function with arity 2 and so on)
